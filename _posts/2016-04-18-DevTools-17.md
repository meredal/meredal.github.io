### Thoughts

_This was a good intro to DevTools, something I've (again) never used before. I only looked into the first couple lessons on here that applied to HTML and CSS as those lessons apply to what I know so far. I watched a couple minutes of the other videos to see if they would be helpful to me or applied to anything I could understand yet, and they did not._

_But! I am pretty sure I will be coming back to the other videos and lessons later once I understand more about JavaScript and my need to make pages load quickly._

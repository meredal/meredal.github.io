## JavaScript Road Trip Part 3

### Lessons

1. __Forest of Function Expressions__ - Learn how to use and manipulate functions as expressions.
2. __Cold Closures Cove__ - Explore the binding of external variables into local scopes.
3. __Hoisting Hills__ - Build an awareness of the pitfalls of load order within a scope.
4. __Ocean of Objects__ - 
Create, fill, and manipulate the generic JavaScript object literal.
5. __Plains of Prototypes__ - Using the magic of object inheritance, explore classes, constructors, prototypes, and properties.

### Thoughts

*These lessons really got into a lot more detail with JavaScript. Honestly, I spent a decent amount of time being confused through these. Getting through the challenges was more difficult than in previous lessons. There was just a lot to complete and the wording was sometimes difficult to follow what they wanted you to complete.*

*I think the key for me on a lot of this is that I can understand a lot of the basic "building block" type concepts that they are discussing in the videos. I have been taking some good notes for myself to be able to come back to when it is time for me to apply this to my own project. I found with some of the previous lessons on Git and CSS I went back to my notes for the first few problems I came across and they really helped me to follow through and be able to solve the problem I was having.*

## Adding a Slideshow to Jewelery using React

### Thoughts

*Before building this slideshow, I built a "throwaway" project to try to get a better understanding of how to use React. I built a few stateless Components, and just wanted to deal with using props, and would then tackle using state in my slideshow. It went well and helped me to get a general feel for using React so I was ready to try and tackle a larger project.*

*For the record, this is still a work in progress. I am close to being finished, but wanted to get down a few thoughts before I finish the project. React is confusing. There are a lot of different ways it can be written and not many standards about best practices, so it is a lot of trial and error. That being said, React is awesome. Once you figure out the problem you're working on, or get the component to render the way you were planning, it is the one of the best feelings. React makes me excited because it is so powerful, and I can understand why so many major companies are using it to keep their websites running quickly and to keep everything as simple and DRY as possible.*

*I'll post more once I finish this project.. check back soon for updates.*

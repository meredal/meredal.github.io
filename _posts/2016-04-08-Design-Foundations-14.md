### Thoughts

#### Introduction to Design 

_These lessons were another basic introduction to design, and very different from what I just did in code school. I am anticipating going through this Treehouse course and getting much more into the details of design._

_That's exciting for me since I do not have a lot of art and design experience. I've taken a few classes here and there throughout my school years, but my studies were all much heavier in math and science. I'm hoping that I'll be able to start to get a better eye for design through these videos and short quizzes._

#### Understanding Aesthetics

_These lessons went through all of the elements of design and talked a little bit about each one and how to recognize them within a composition. The last lesson was a quick lesson about how to critique a design._

_This will be helpful for me to be able to look at a website and explain the design and use the correct terminology for my explanations. I know that I'm not necessarily going to design something on my own, but I think it's important to understand the different parts that go into the design as I'm building them._

...

_And that was basically the end of the course about design foundations. The next lesson was about how to be a problem solver, which I have done for years in my other jobs (and used to teach 9 ad 10 year old children how to do it too). So it was a good refresher but not any groundbreaking information I had never heard before._ 

_I was hoping for more from this course so I was a little disappointed. But I did take away some good things from this course: mostly about the elements of a design and how to critique a design. This course only took about two hours to watch the videos and complete the short multiple choice quizzes, so it wasn't a total waste of time._

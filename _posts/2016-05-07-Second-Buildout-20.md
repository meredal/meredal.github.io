## From Photoshop Mockup to Responsive Webpage

### Thoughts

_Whew! This one actually took me longer to complete than the first page, but I learned quite a few more lessons in building this page than I did on the first project. From start to finish, this took me about 22 hours. Comparing the first two I felt a little defeated that it took me 10 more hours, but there were more sections, more pieces to figure out, a sidebar, making sure it was pixel perfect, and I made the website responsive at different resolutions, too. I know this will all be second nature at some point, but for only my second project, tackling more tasks meant taking more time to remember what it was that I learned however many weeks ago and how to apply it again._

_With this project I really started to use the Chrome Developer tools to adjust the CSS styles on different elements. Once I got something the way I wanted it, I transfered it back into my Sass file. That helped me to move faster and continue to gain an understanding about CSS styles and how they affect elements on the page throughout the project._

_A few other things I learned building this project:_

- _Span tags. Super cool! I used them inbetween my list items on the sidebar to create the visible separation between each `li`._
- _Building a `div` around a section or around a few tags to group them together and be able to style them together._
- _Margins and paddings within sections. I'm sure there is a lot more to learn on this subject, but I feel like I am getting a better grasp on when to use each and how it will affect the page and its elements._
- _Using lorem ipsum text for every single thing on this page got old.. real fast. It was like gibberish all the time._

_Last but very not least, I made this page responsive. To go with my learning curve, I built the page at a single width and then went back and made it responsive. The plan in the future is to be doing this as I go along, but for this buildout it seemed to go well. I learned a lot of lessons about using percentages, ways to build my html to make my CSS more DRY, and I'm sure there is more that I'm missing. Onto the next!_

##Front End Foundations
The first set of lessons in Code School brings you through the basics of HTML and CSS. Way back in undergrad I took a class about teaching your students to make websites (remember, elementary education major). And I did well, but that was 2005? I think. And being that we would be teaching young children, it was incredibly basic. But, I think that helped me to have somewhat of an understanding before going into these first lessons. 

Below is a list of the lessons and their descriptions as they are listed on the CodeSchool Website. I will continue to list the lessons in this format for each set of lessons I go through, then add a quick blurb of my "thoughts" about the lessons.

###Lessons
1. __HTML__ - Format text content and links with HTML
2. __CSS__ - Change the way that content is displayed with CSS.
3. __Classes and Layout__ - Reuse CSS across multiple pages and layout content in well-defined sections.
4. __Images__ - Add content and background images to your site.
5. __Fonts and Forms__ - Customize fonts and add forms that accept different types of user input.

###Thoughts
_It was cool to see that through the first couple lessons, I actually knew a few things! And, for the most part, understood the language. CSS was brand new for me, but I like the idea that it will help to clean up code and make it easier to read. When I learned whatever I learned in college, we were adjusting all of the text we were writing in html with tags. We would use a `<b>` for making bold text, and other similar tags for adjusting whatever silly kind of website we made._

_Code School puts you through challenges at the end of each lesson to help you to get a further understanding of what you just learned. I'm very visual, so it was really helpful to be able to practice the points that were taught, but also to see a screen with two panes, one for the code I was writing and another for how that code would affect the page I was working on. Apparently this is a thing I'll be able to do once I'm doing my own code, too. So that will be a good thing for me to look forward to. I'm excited to get into the next lessons and to see what direction I'll be heading from here!_

### Thoughts

*JavaScript is definitely a difficult language to understand, but some things really started to click here... finally. I think parts of it had be the fact that a lot of the information here was aimed towards making code simpler, easier to read, etc. Well GREAT. Because it was super hard to understand before.*

*I'm looking forward to learning more about JavaScript and hopefully being able to put it into practice soon.*

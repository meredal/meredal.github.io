### Thoughts

_I feel like these lessons brought me more into the "real world" of design. Before these lessons, everything had been in fixed widths and height for pictures, fonts, etc. and it was mentioned early on that they would teach us how to adjust for different size screens and this is where it all came together._

_I liked going through the challenges and watching what adjusting the screen size did to the webpage and I liked bringing some simple math into this, too. I know this will be something I use often when building webpages or adding features to a page. I think I got a really good basic understanding of how it works and can apply what I've learned in the future._

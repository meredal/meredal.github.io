## Adobe Illustrator for Web Design

### Lessons

1. __Starting Your Adobe Illustrator Project__ - First, preview the assets that you will be creating in the course. We will then talk about the unique qualities of vector graphics and SVGs, and how they relate to modern needs of responsive web design. After a brief overview of the workspace and how to customize it, we will go step by step through the process of creating a new document with multiple artboards and preparing a design for mobile and desktop platforms.
2. __Creating a Wireframe__ - In this section, create a wireframe for mobile and desktop using basic boxes and lines to represent content and define how spaces within the webpage will be used. Then, move on to adding in typography and buttons. Finally, learn all about how to use Styles.
3. __Logo Design__ - In this section, you will create the graphic logo. Beginning with a sketch, you will bring it all the way to a finished vector illustration with typography.
4. __Webpage Mockup__ - In this section, you will bring the wireframe to life by adding the logo, color, images, and finishing design touches.
5. __Save for the Web__ - Save for web, including how to export SVGs and using CSS properties within Illustrator.

### Thoughts

_Surprise. I have also never used Illustrator before this course. The videos walked through the basics of the program, how to use the tools, a lot of keyboard shortcuts, and another website mockup._

_This was different than the Photoshop course. The instructor was a graphic designer, so she was not a hybrid as it was in the last course. I think I will come across this type of person more often in wherever my future workplace may be. I made the logo using pen and shape tools, and exported it out as SVG. I made the mobile and desktop version of the site. I tried to use the same colors as what were used in the video (but had to guess at the swatches from the color pickers in the video). I also learned how to export graphics a couple different ways and how to make sure they are the right quality and size for the website you're building._

_Overall, I think this was a good introduction to Illustrator and how a designer that I would be working with could be using the program. Some of the things I noticed as we were moving through the design was how different her style was from the last course. I feel like that is to be expected, not everyone is going to organize the same way, and that's okay. I liked getting a different view of design with a different person and a different program._

_My next step will be to start building out some designs from Photoshop. I'm excited to be using Photoshop and Illustrator and to start getting the full picture of these programs and other programs I will want to be using moving forward in this learing process!_

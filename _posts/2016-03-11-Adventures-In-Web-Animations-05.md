##Adventures in Web Animations

###Lessons
1. __Transitions__ - Learn how to sweeten up your web app using CSS transitions for color, position, and visibility.
2. __Transforms__ - Moving, scaling, invisibility â€” oh my! Open up a world of animation possibilities with transforms.
3. __Keyframes__ - Use keyframe animations to create some tasty and reusable animations for our form modal and donut character.
4. __SVG__ - Explore the benefits of using super-crisp SVGs and how to animate them.  

###Thoughts
_OMG These lessons were SO fun! I feel like it sounds silly to be so excited about it, but learning how to make things move on the page was awesome. After making each animation in the challenges, I sat to watch how it was rendered on the page to understand a bit more about what I actually did._

_When I have some free time later I'm planning to do a little web exploration to check out more animations and responsive layouts. These last two lessons have been two of the most beneficial lessons yet._

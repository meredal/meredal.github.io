###Thoughts
_Most of this course just really built on the basics and fundamentals. I took a lot of quick notes along the way to help me remember what an element is or does or how to style something, and then putting it into practice in the challenges at the end of the lesson. Pretty quick and straightforward, but it should be nice to build more on these basics of HTML5 and CSS3 as I move forward._

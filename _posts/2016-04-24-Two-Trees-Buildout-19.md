## From Photoshop Mockup to Webpage

### Thoughts

_There are no specific lessons to list out for this post. This lesson was really geared towards putting together all the things I've learned so far. My first project was to take the Two Trees Photoshop Mockup from the Lynda.com tutorial, and make it into a static webpage._

_This was, in short, a challenge. I've learned so much in the last almost 8 weeks, and now I wasn't going through a challenge on a webpage tutorial, I had to actually put all the knowledge to use and make something. I kept track of time as I have been doing throughout this entire journey, and I will likely post this at some point.. but specifically related to this page from start to finish it took me about 12.5 hours._

_I was surprised how much html, CSS, and Sass I remembered along the way, and how helpful the notes I've been taking for classes helped me to build this webpage. The giddy excitement I had when I first made the small logo show up on the page was pretty awesome. Like, I did that, and made that show up there. And then I made it move to the center of the page. I wrote that. Seriously, that's so simple, but so awesome. The rest of the html portion was pretty quick. It helped me to get all the elements on the page and then be able to move on from there._

_I really liked being able to build something locally and then as I adjusted my Sass, I could see how that adjusted the elements on the page. The first couple sections took me the longest amount of time per section. But I learned along the way and it made the later sections take less time._

_Going through the process of styling everything also helped me to fix my html. Sometimes I needed to add a `<div>` and sometimes I should have added an `id` or `class` to an element. I think the more I do of these, the easier it will be to do those things from the beginning rather than adding everything as I build the stylesheet._

_I know it is important to build something with clean code, but also to be building it quickly. I have a few more pages to build before I move into a new section of learning and I am hoping that these next buildouts will help me to be efficient and fast (or at least faster than this page)._

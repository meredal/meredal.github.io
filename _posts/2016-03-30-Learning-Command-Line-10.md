### Thoughts

_I've used command line ... maybe once or twice before this. But knowing some basics of command line now is really helpful to understand how to move through directories. A lot of what I've read through these lessons is that I should be using the command line every day to stay familiar with it and keep my mind fresh about it. So I'm going to attempt to keep using it when moving around on my computer for and see how that goes. I definitely think it will help me to remember and memorize commands._

_What is probably even more exciting is that now I have enough of an understanding to get my blog up and running on GitHub! I can only imagine that it will take me a little while, but these first 10 lessons will all be part of one of my first commits to my personal GitHub page/Jekyll blog. Then I will just keep it updated as I go along. Until I'm live on a webpage..._

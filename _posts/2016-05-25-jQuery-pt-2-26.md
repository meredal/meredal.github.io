## jQuery: The Return Flight

### Lessons

1. __Ajax Basics__ - Learn what Ajax is and how it can be used.
2. __JavaScript and jQuery__ - Organize your jQuery and JavaScript.
3. __Ajax With Forms__ - Learn about how to send data to the server and work with JSON.
4. __Utility Methods__ - Learn about some handy utility methods including `$.each` and `$.map` while working with complicated JSON data.
5. __jQuery Plugins__ - Create your own reusable jQuery plugin.
6. __Promises__ - Use promises to make your Ajax calls reusable and organized.

### Thoughts

*These lessons went into Ajax calls and how to write them and deal with them. The lessons got progressively more detailed as I went through and I could follow just about all of them and understand how to implement them in the challenges. Promises were probably the most difficult for me to follow. But I think I at least got a basic understanding.*

*These lessons and the previous course on jQuery helped me to understand how JavaScript can be implemented into my code a lot better than the first few courses on JavaScript did. I hope I am starting to get more of an overall understanding of this language and how I'll be able to put it into practice in my own projects.*

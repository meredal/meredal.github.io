## Assembling Sass

### Lessons 

1. __Foundation__ - An introduction to Sass, imports, comments, and nesting.
2. __Variable__ - Creation and use of recallable information.
3. __Mixin__ - Writing reusable styles mixed with optional arguments.
4. __Extend__ - Easily manage CSS class reuse and inheritance in the stylesheet, rather than HTML.
5. __Directive__ - A primer on the programmatic tools in Sass, including functions and each loops.
6. __Math + Color__ - Perform arithmetic and color alterations directly to stylesheet values.
7. __Responsive__ - Simplify and optimize your responsive design workflow via Sass.

### Thoughts

_These lessons brought me back into using and working with CSS with a new addition to it. Starting with a preprocessor to basically write the CSS for me: Sass. This was a bit of a change after only looking at command line and github for the last couple weeks._

_Quick props to Code School for the way that they build on your previous knowledge. I feel like I can understand these new concepts after I have learned the long hand version before it. I was reminded of math when I was younger, learning alllll the steps to a long problem and then learning how to do the same function in your calculator, or some other shortened version. That is kinda like Sass and CSS._

_As far as I can tell, Sass seems more efficient, simple, and easier to keep all of your CSS DRY. I like it. It does seem like it can be confusing at times though, likely because I'm just starting to use it. But the videos reminded me multiple times to check how the Sass compiles into CSS before pushing it out, so I'll have to be sure to do that every time I'm working with Sass._

_At the end of the lesson, there was a wrapup video (as there usually is with other lessons). It suggested that we install Sass. I hopped onto my Terminal and installed it right from the command line. And I understood what I was doing! I feel like I'm starting to gain more and more understanding of a larger picture as I move through these lessons, and that is pretty cool._

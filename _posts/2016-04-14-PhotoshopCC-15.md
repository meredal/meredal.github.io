### Thoughts

_My first attempt on learning Photoshop was with a Treehouse course about Photoshop for web design. Being someone who has never used Photoshop before, the course was not helpful for me so I sought out something else. I ended up with this awesome course on lynda.com. They walk you through the basics of Photoshop and then through the process of making a full mockup of a small one-page design for a fake company._

_I made it through a couple lessons and started to realize how awesome this course was. I felt like I was learning a lot, and getting a low-level understanding of design. I think it will be pretty important to be a developer who has some understanding of Photoshop and design in the future so I was excited to keep moving and learn more._

_The instructor for this lesson is a hybrid designer/developer and it seemed like he had a good handle on how to make a design that will work well for both a designer and a developer. Throughout the lessons he made comments about how setting up folders or labeling something a certain way would be really helpful on the handoff to the developer. I liked that as it helped me keep things organized, but it also gave me an idea of how to look through files that would be handed off to me, and how something could be organized in an ideal situation. Throughout the entire process, I kept trying to think about how I would maybe use this as a developer. Understanding all these basic layers and fonts and how they are all set up within Photoshop will help me to be able to get the information I need out of a designers mock up for a site and I'll be able to use the program while I'm building out the site the way the designer wants it to look._

_The first big task was learning to make a wireframe. It talked about setting up guides for the full document, and even an awesome tool that would set up columns and gutters for you. This part was pretty cool to see the simple beginnings of a single page design and to try to think through how it would be developed from there._

_Next we went through some basics and shortcuts to choosing a color theme, a talk through the font toolkit, and how to set up paragraph styles and load them into the document I want._

_When we got to the section about UI Elements, I'll be honest, I had to figure out what in the world a UI Theme was... I had no idea. But once I got that down, we walked through ome simple UI Themes and Icon Fonts, where you can find them on the web, and how to get them loaded into Photoshop. This was nice to see that you don't have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to some simple parts of a website like buttons, scroll bars, icons, etc._

_Once we had all the pieces, it was time to add everything to the wireframe and turn the wireframe into a mockup of the website. We applied the color and font theme throughout, added some text from the client, added images, and so on. Then we went through and made sure everything looked appropriate and all of the layers were cleaned up and ready to hand off to a developer._

_The last couple sections were some extra points that were made about optimiaing graphics, SVGs, and Image Sprites._

_This entire course was really helpful in learning about design and keeping my head on the development side. One of my next steps will be to build out some pages from a Photoshop mockup (including this final mockup). I'm excited to put all of this new knowledge to the test very soon!_

### Photoshop Files from this Course

- [Initial Wireframe](/Photoshop/Two-Trees-Wireframe-V1.psd) - This was the first wireframe that we made. Very simple, just boxes and text.
- [Second Wireframe](/Photoshop/Two-Trees-Wireframe-V2.psd) - This is the second wireframe with a font theme, some simple icons and UI elements added.
- [Final Website Mockup](/Photoshop/Two-Trees-Mockup.psd) - The final mockup of the one-page website for Two Trees.

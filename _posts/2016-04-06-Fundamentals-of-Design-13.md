### Thoughts

_So far I've learned quite a bit about how to code exactly what has been given to me... make this box to be a width of 350px, make the line height 2, use Helvetica as the font, and so on._

_These lessons all helped me to understand how to choose some of those elements myself. Here's a quick rundown of everything that was covered:_

- _Serif and Sans Serif fonts, how to recognize them and the correct way to match them on your page according to your content._
- _Basic understanding of hue, saturation and lightness of colors. How to adjust colors on your pages and pick a basic color scheme that is visually pleasing and functional._
- _Introduction to the grid system of organizing a website. Where each part of the website belongs and why. Splitting pieces on the website to be symmetrical or assymmetrical. All keeping in mind that you want to guide your user through the content with the design._

_These lessons were great for me to wrap my head around the basics of design. I feel like they helped me to be able to articulate what I like or dislike about a website when I'm looking at it. And they will help me when building out a design to keep the appropriate sizing, spacing, fonts, and colors in mind for all elements._

### Thoughts

_Before I start building things out, it's probably useful for me to start learning how to use my text editor to the fullest. This course from Lynda was really helpful to walk me through all the basics of Atom, some really helpful key commands, and how I can adjust my settings and add packages to make the program work for me and what I need as I complete projects in the future._

_There was also some really informative videos about how Atom works with Git and GitHub. I like how it can work with these, and may help me speed up my workflow on some future projects, too._

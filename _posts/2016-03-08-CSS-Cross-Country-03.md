### Thoughts

_I started writing on this one before I finished the whole set of lessons. Why? Well, I started the first lesson and felt like I had NO idea what I was doing. I could kinda follow the lessons but then I got into the challenges and I was lost. I felt like I didn't quite understand what they were asking me to do with the CSS. My head was thinking, "This might be the end of my ability to understand this stuff". This is a whole new type of field for me to try to understand so there have been some nerves here and there that it will all be a little too complicated at some point._

_Clearly, I got worried too soon. I started the second lesson, and it turned right back around for me and everything seemed to make some sense again. I went back to the challenges on the first lesson and realized what I wasn't understanding the first time, the difference between class, id, and element selectors and the differences of how everything was written.  Once I figured it out, it made everything flow again and I could understand what I was doing and the vocabulary that the teachers in the videos were using._

_The challenges made me think more than they had in the first few lessons. And that was awesome. I know this is going to be a challenge in the "real world", so I wanted these challenges to make me think and problem solve a bit. I'm feeling a bit like I'm really starting to understand CSS basics... pretty cool._

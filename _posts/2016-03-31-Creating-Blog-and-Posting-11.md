## Blog Setup & Posting to GitHub


### Choosing a Theme

_This was one of the fun parts of this process. I wanted something that was going to support what I wanted to put on my blog, mostly text. I went with [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), and I really like the way it looks so far._

### Set Up Jekyll Blog & Create Personal Git Page

_These two really go together. Just the basics of following directions from my GitHub lesson in Code School, and some of the directions given on my theme's page. This was the first time I was going to commit something to GitHub for real, not just on a challenge from some Code School lessons. I didn't want to do anything wrong with my commits so I was carefully reading through everything. Overall this part wasn't too bad. I ran into a couple issues getting some parts installed, but figured them out pretty quickly and was able to move on to the next part of the process._

### Insert Posts

_Once I had the theme on my computer and set up to be tracked locally, I could go ahead and make the changes that I wanted to make before posting it to GitHub. At this point I really just wanted to get it up there, and make sure it was a clean commit. There are some other things I think I may want to change or add, but those could wait until after the initial commit was made with all the posts I have been writing since I started this whole thing last month._

_Since the posts were already written in Markdown on another file on my computer, this didn't take too long. I just did a lot of copy/pasting and then adjusted for any spelling errors I had made before._

### Commit & Push to GitHub

_Last thing to do was commit everything and then push it up to GitHub. And there it is! Or I suppose here it is.. since you're on the page looking at it right now. I'll keep posting as I complete a new lesson or section in Code School or online tutorial of some type._

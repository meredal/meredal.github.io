### Thoughts

_So I'm switching over for a little while to learn a new language, JavaScript. Part of the plan from the beginning was to learn one major language besides just html, CSS, Sass, etc. I know there are a lot of different paths to try, and likely some that wouldn't be as difficult as JavaScript (because from what I hear it is not very easy).. but JavaScript is the winner. From what I understand right now, JavaScript is heavily supported by browsers, it's constantly being improved upon and developed, and has plenty of additional frameworks and libraries to learn. And I am hoping that will help me someday to be able to land a job._

_I also hope that because I am learning one of the most difficult languages to learn, that should I decide to learn another like Ruby or Python (which I understand a lot of companies like to use too), that grasping new concepts won't be as much of a struggle as what JavaScript is apparently about to be for me._

_But I digress. The first set of JavaScript lessons.. not too bad! We started building the basics of the language and learning the basic terms, operators, and comparators.  It went through a lot of simple details with variables, too. How to make a variable, adjust and change it around. The very last lesson showed how to make a JavaScript file and access the file in your html document. Boom. One lesson down.. lots more to go..._

## Try jQuery

### Lessons

1. __Introduction to jQuery__ - A gentle introduction to what jQuery is, and what it can do.
2. __Traversing the DOM__ - Search & walk through the DOM with selectors and traversing.
3. __Working with the DOM__ - Add & remove from the DOM, more traversing, and user events.
4. __Listening to DOM Events__ - Listen for events, handle them, and change the default event behavior of web browsers.
5. __Styling__ - Before landing, tame CSS with jQuery and animate elements on the page.

### Thoughts

*Well jQuery is pretty cool! It was interesting to learn about the DOM, traversing through it, adjusting CSS styles... and being able to do all of it through JavaScript. This is one of the first lessons where I could see how I could use JavaScript on some of the sample webpages I have already built. Making that connection was really helpful*

*Right now the goal is to be moving towards learning React, so I know I won't be using jQuery for everything, but it was nice to connect some missing pieces for me and start to feel like I have more of an understanding of what I'm doing.*

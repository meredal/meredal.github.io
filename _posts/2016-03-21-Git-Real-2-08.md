## Git Real 2

### Lessons

1. __Interactive Rebase__ - Edit your commits through the use of interactive rebase
2. __Stashing__ - Not quite ready to commit? Git stash is the perfect solution
3. __Purging History__ - Accidentally commit something sensitive? Purge it!
4. __Working Together__ - Make Git work together on multiple operating systems
5. __Submodules__ - Ever wanted to use another repository inside of another?
6. __Reflog__ - Undo almost anything and find lost commits using reflog  

### Thoughts

_Getting more Git practice is definitely helping me to understand it better. These lessons really added some more "real-world" type situations of working on projects with others, or what could happen if you deleted something that you later realize that you need and how to recover previous commits or files. One more course to master GitHub!_

## JavaScript Road Trip Part 2

### Lessons

1. __The Labyrinth of Loops__ - Understand and build loops for repeated code with 'while' and 'for' syntax.
2. __Conditional Canyon__ - Use conditions to execute different branches of code with if-else blocks.
3. __Built-In's Bluff__ - Learn to use the basic JavaScript dialog box functions 'prompt', 'alert', and 'confirm'.
4. __The Desert of Declarations__ - Understand functions and building custom functionality.
5. __The Array Archipelago__ - Learn to build and manipulate the array data structure.

### Thoughts

_The first set of lessons wasn't too bad, but these lessons quickly got more and more complex. The main focus for all of the lessons was loops and functions. How to read them, and more importantly how to build them for all different types of situations. The challenges were difficult, but by the end I was starting to actually understand what it was that I was putting into each function and building the loops to get my desired outcomes. I don't think I have an advanced understanding just yet, but I do think I got a good basic understanding so far._

_Even though it is difficult at times, I am enjoying the problem solving and math in all of it. I think similar to what I have just experienced in learning html and CSS, the more I use it, the better I will actually start to understand it._

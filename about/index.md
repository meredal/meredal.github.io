This site is now acting as my portfolio. But it started as just a blog to keep track of what I was learning and how I was feeling about it during the process. I wanted to have a short section with a little bit about me and why in the world I am attempting to be some type of developer. 

#### March 2016
 
I have a Bachelors Degree (2007) in Elementary Education and Middle School Mathematics and a Masters Degree (2012) in Exercise Science and Nutrition Behaviors. Not the most relatable degrees, but we'll get there. After undergrad, I spent two years as a teacher, then went to grad school while working in the Athletics and Recreation Department at my university. I spent my time working in building operations, aquatics, and special events.  

My side of special events work turned into a full on special events job in December 2012 when I took a position working for a running events company. For two years, I planned and produced 200 mile overnight running relays followed by one year of 1000 foot long slip-n-slides. Both positions allowed me to travel all over the United States and fueled my official love for travel.  

At the beginning of December 2015, I packed my belongings into a storage unit in Salt Lake City, Utah, and headed out for the "adventure of a lifetime": traveling the world.  

Just one problem.. you can't exactly be an event director for events in the states when you are no longer living in the US. So part of embarking on this adventure meant giving up my career. Well.. now what?  

My boyfriend started dabbling in web development in his teenage years, and is currently a full stack developer. He's told me quite a few times that I could learn how to be a developer and that he thinks I would be quite good at it. As an added bonus, I would have his expertise to help me through the learning process.  

Easy, right? _Wellll_, I guess we will see. I'm enrolled in Code School right now, and starting to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I'll expand from there. Because I'm blogging everything else in my life right now ([My Travel Blog](http://meredal.wordpress.com)), he and I thought it would be interesting to see my thoughts about the learning process as it's happening. So.. here we go.

#### June 2016

I have made it through to the other side! A few months later, and I feel that I am ready to start applying to jobs. So I suppose if you're looking at this now, you might be a potential employer. 

I hope these pages with some of my work as well as the blog I kept while learning give you a good idea of my skills so far. I have learned a lot, but this is just the beginning for me. A future position as a junior developer will give me the opportunity to work with and learn from others, and to continue to further develop my skills. I'm excited for the possibilities!

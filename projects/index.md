## Two Trees

#### [View here: http://meredal.github.io/twotrees](http://meredal.github.io/twotrees/)

This was the first page I built. I took a Photoshop for Web Design Tutorial on Lynda.com and built the wireframe and mockup files during the class. Then later, I built the webpage. Two Trees was built with fixed widths. 

- To read about the Photoshop Tutorial, check out my [Lesson 15 - Photoshop CC for Web Design](http://meredal.github.io/PhotoshopCC-15/) blog post.
- To read about building the webpage and some lessons I learned, check out my [Lesson 19 - Building Two Trees](http://meredal.github.io/Two-Trees-Buildout-19/) blog post.

# Selly

#### [View here: http://meredal.github.io/sellysample](http://meredal.github.io/sellysample/)

Selly was built to be responsive. After learning about jQuery, I came back and added some functionality to the sidebar and the signup form.

- I used this free [Dribbble Design](http://dribbble.com/shots/1325586-Free-PSD-Clean-Landing-Page) to build this page from the Photoshop file. Thanks to Michał Ptaszyński for a great design!
- To read about building the webpage and some lessons I learned, check out my [Lesson 20 - Building Selly](http://meredal.github.io/Second-Buildout-20/) blog post.
- To read about adding jQuery to the webpage, check out my [Lesson 28 - Adding jQuery to Selly](http://meredal.github.io/jQuerify-Selly-28/) blog post.

# Jewelery

#### [View here: http://meredal.github.io/jewelrybuildout](http://meredal.github.io/jewelrybuildout/)

Jewelery was built to be responsive and browser compliant. After learning about React, I wanted to build a slideshow on this page. This is still a work in progress, but you can still view the page as it stands here: 

- I used this free [Dribbble Design](http://dribbble.com/shots/1687932-Jewelery) to build this page from the Photoshop file. Thanks to Vlad Musienko for a great design!
- To read about building the webpage and some lessons I learned, check out my [Lesson 27 - Building Jewelery](http://meredal.github.io/Third-Buildout-27/) blog post.
- I am currently working on a Slideshow for this page using React. So it is still a work on progress. Once that is finished I will be blogging about it and post it here.
